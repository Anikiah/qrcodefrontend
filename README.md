Reflection:

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
  I helps a great deal with gettiing accurate scaling for items and starter code lines.

What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
  I had a line of code in my img tag that would not align properly. It took me almost an hour to figure out that my img class names did not match from HTML to CSS.
  I had a similiar issue with my Blog Card, I had to restructure the img tag completely toget the image to show. I initially thought it was because the image ended in .svg. So, I screenshot the image and saves it as a .jpeg file but, that was not the issue. I had a div that was not closed. smh lol

How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
  I havent had a lot of time this weekend to explore the site but the challenges helped me grow tremendously with Figma.
